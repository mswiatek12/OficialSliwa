# Razor Pages Project with PostgreSQL and Entity Framework

This is a Razor Pages web application built using C#, PostgreSQL, Entity Framework, and other modern web technologies. It uses a combination of server-side rendering and client-side interaction to create a responsive and dynamic web application.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The primary programming language used for backend development.
- **Razor Pages**: A feature of ASP.NET Core used to create dynamic web pages with a clean separation of concerns.
- **Entity Framework Core**: The Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) used for interacting with the PostgreSQL database, allowing you to work with data as objects rather than SQL queries.
- **Identity**: ASP.NET Core Identity is used for managing user authentication and authorization.
- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database management system used to store and manage application data.
- **Npgsql**: The .NET data provider for PostgreSQL, enabling communication between the application and the PostgreSQL database.
- **HTML**: Markup language used for creating the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and layout of the application, making the web pages visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side scripting language used for adding dynamic behavior and interactivity to the web pages.
